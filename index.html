<h2>Simon Purdue</h2>

<body>
My name is Simon Purdue and I am a PhD student studying history at
Northeastern University. My research interests primarily involve labor 
and migration, specifically Irish-American Migration and gender. My
interests also include Urban history, occupational health and the history
of medicine. I recieved my BA (International) in Single Honours history
from University College Dublin in 2015, then recieved a Wellcome Trust
Humanities Studentship to continue my research at the masters Level.
My MA thesis explored occupational health and gender in the heavy industries
of Belfast between 1870 and 1914. At the doctoral level I hope to continue
researching in this vein, exploring the question of migration, gender and 
work in the northeastern United States.
